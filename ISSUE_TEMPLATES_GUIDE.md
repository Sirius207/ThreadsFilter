## üéØ Best Practices for Issue Reporting

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check if your issue has already been reported

3. **Test with Different Settings**: Try different extension configurations
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure it's not a caching issue
5. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages

### Writing Effective Issues

#### Be Specific and Detailed

- **Good**: "The extension doesn't filter comments on post pages"
- **Better**: "When I visit https://threads.net/@username/post/123, comments from accounts with less than 100 followers are not being filtered, even though I have 'Minimum Followers' set to 1000"

#### Provide Complete Information

- Browser version and OS
- Extension version
- Current settings
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

#### Include Visual Evidence

- Screenshots of the issue
- Console error messages
- Performance metrics
- Before/after comparisons

#### Use Clear Language

- Write in clear, concise sentences
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include relevant links
- Avoid jargon when possible

### Issue Template Guidelines

#### Required Fields

Always fill out all required sections in the template. If a section doesn't apply, write "N/A" or "Not applicable" rather than leaving it blank.

#### Optional Fields

Even if marked as optional, provide information when relevant:

- Screenshots often help explain issues
- Console errors provide debugging clues
- Environment details help reproduce problems

#### Code Blocks

When sharing code, console output, or configuration:

- Use proper code blocks with language syntax
- Format JSON/configuration properly
- Include relevant line numbers
- Remove sensitive information
